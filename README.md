# About
`i3` pools my *i3* configuration files and a *Makefile* to install
the last stable release of i3.

# Motivation 
1. Good management of my workspace to work efficiently.
2. Share my setting system

# Install

1. To install the last release of `i3` run the commands:

	cd path/to/i3/
	sudo su          # or just `su` if you have set a password for the root user
	make install

Get complete information at [i3 documentation - repositories](https://i3wm.org/docs/repositories.html).

2. Configuration files: Copy or make a symlink of the files `./.i3status.conf` 
and `.config/i3/config` into your home directory. If your using this
repository as a part of my `settings` repository, you can also see its README.md.
